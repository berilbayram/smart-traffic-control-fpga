smart-traffic-control-fpga

Objective
    The aim of this project was to design a smart traffic control system for congestion and
emergency vehicles. The regular traffic lights are not working effectively enough to reduce
the congestion on the busy roads. In addition to that, emergency vehicles such as ambulances
need to have priority among other vehicles because if not some patients will not be able to
reach hospitals on time. In order to solve these problems, I implemented a smart traffic
controlling system. This project was implemented in VHDL on Basys3 board.

Equipment
1- Ultrasonic Sensors (HC â€“ SR 04)
2- FRID Stickers (13.56MHz RFID Sticker)
3- FRID Readers (13.56MHz RFID Reader RC522)
